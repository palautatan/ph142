# About me
Hello, hello! I'm Edie, and I'm probably your GSI or friend or both. Here's a little on my background so you can **trust me** when I teach you!

## Teaching philosophy
I'm one half academic instructor (for you) and one half athletic instructor (for my karate students), and my two sides unavoidably mesh together. I will always try my best to give you what you need as students; I aim to be your faithful academic plug. I apologize in advance for my overanimated facial expressions, my graduate student fatigue, and (sometimes) sharp tongue, but I'll give you no BS in my classroom. Xoxo.

## Education and Experience
You can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/palautatan/">LinkedIn</a> profile for more. You can add me as well! No awkwardness, I'm just a person.

## Hobbies
I like to do a lot of things! I love music, teach karate, avoid playing The Sims 4, and can't live without caffeine.
