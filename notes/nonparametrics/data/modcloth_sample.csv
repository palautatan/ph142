First off, they're not really jeans per se, more like leggings in terms of fit (super tight and super stretchy) but they are also really sturdy like regular jeans, so you kind of get the best of both worlds. The sizing seems pretty accurate, I'm typically a size 68 and the mediums fit me fine. Honestly with these, it's better for them to be a little on the small side, since they will definitely stretch as you wear them.The only thing I wish is that they came in different lengths.

I didn't find that any of my necklaces really worked with the neckline but I also didn't feel I really needed one.This dress is so soft and comfortable that it's like wearing really pretty, sociallyacceptable pajamas. It is very long, so if you're short I would bank on only wearing heels or getting it hemmed. I could stand to get it taken up, but it's not so long that it's a problem. I wear it with sandals but hold it up a lot as I walk and it's probably still going to quickly get dirty at the bottom. The fit is amazing, flattering and tailored without clinging, though it gapes a little at the top where the two sides of the vneck overlap and shows my bra sometimes because of that. I've worn it to the office and on the weekends and to parties and it really works for everything, though it's probably best served hanging out on a yacht while drinking some wine.

I hand wash what I need to hand wash, dry clean what needs to be, and I try to avoid having to machine dry most of my clothing. I made sure that this cardigan got the utmost care but alas it was unavoidable. As of this moment, the entire bottom portion (under the boob) is so pilly as well as the sleeves.

I had been wanting a red dress and this one was just too cute to pass up. This was the first ModCloth dress I got, and I had been wanting to get my hands on one for approaching a year. (Not for lack of trying: I really wanted the Flavor Fave dress but they never had it in my size. I kept requesting it, but the second they got it back in, someone else bought the one XS that they brought back. When I finally ordered it, it was an oversale and I was devastated. Now it's completely out of stock. But I digress.) Anyway, this dress is wonderful. It's the perkiest cherry red and I got an insane amount of complements. Although it does wrinkle and pockets would make it even better, I LOVE that while it has sleeves, they do not come up to cover your armpits, so you can't pit it out! It hits the middle or top of my knee (so it's the perfect length) but it feels plenty long enough and the skirt won't start sneaking up to a nondress code length. Awesome dress."

The pant legs are a little long, but that's not a new issue for me, since I have shorter legs.

I actually had to send the medium back and order the large because I'm pretty tall (5'11) and my shoulders are a little wide, and the large has more room for an outfit underneath. It's also long, which is really great for me. I just figured out the hood yesterday it doesn't zip off, like I was expecting, but instead zips into the collar, which is something I've never seen before. I haven't worn it like that yet, but it could be helpful when it gets cold. The sleeves are also long which made me really happy because it's so hard to find jackets with sleeves that fit me nowadays. I probably won't be using the double zipper feature very often one is enough for me. The front two zippers don't zip down to anything, which would have been cool, but that's okay. I've never had a jacket with a collar like this, but I really like it. I think it'll keep me pretty warm on colder days. The material is like a thin sweatshirt, and in places there are a few more layers on. Overall, it was exactly what I was looking for and what I though it would be, and I'm really happy I decided to get the larger size and not give up on it."
