The fabric is very soft and surprisingly warm.

I used to wear vests to cover the gap, but they've been harder to find lately. This jumper, however, does it perfectly. Which means I get to rotate a lot of my shirts back into my regular wardrobe again.I got this in 2X, and it's the right fit for me. It has room at the bust, but that's how the jumper is designed (I measure 46 inches there). It fits perfectly at the waist (although it is a little high waisted and sits at the bottom of my ribcage). The pockets are great. The skirt stops just above my knees. I got compliments at work the first time I wore it."

Though they've raised the nonsale price since then, I couldn't even keep the Ivory at 35 bucks. The material is much thinner/more prone to wrinkles and the zipper is flimsier than the old skirt, and the ivory color is more of a yellowy cream. I've included a picture for color comparison with an actual ivory blanket, and a picture of the mint skirt I got a few years ago, where you can see the difference in quality. Really hope they didn't up the price and lower the fabric quality of all of them, just the new white color, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. So sad, as this was a beautiful, high quality skirt."

Plus the apron jumper dress style is totally adorable!  However, on the first day i wore this, the button holding the first strap popped off. I was walking around a renn faire so this was not great timing. Then an hour later the OTHER button holding the left side broke. I ended up having to tie the jumpers together halter style just to get home. The straps were not on tight, in fact prior to breaking they kept sliding off my shoulders. So the buttons don't hold up the straps. I will be able to fix this because I am going to shorter the straps and sew some elastic on to the end to prevent this from happening again. But seriously, both straps within hours of wearing it failed!  The dress is gorgeous and worth owning, but don't wear it until you modify those straps."

I am not a fan of the tie in back of the shirt, and am just cutting it off; since I plan to wear it mostly tucked in with skirts, the waistband will do the same cinching as the tie.

I wear 32C or 34B and it fit fine. I think M could fit up to 36D no problem, due to the cut and stretch of the fabric. one thing I did not notice is that there is a little bit of puff right at the top of the cap sleeve.

It's a beautiful highwaisted skirt, and I like the pockets. It's on the long side, which I love, but it may be problematic for someone who isn't 5'10. The fabric is satiny smooth, and I've gotten lots of compliments after just a couple wears. There are a couple spots that could use improvement. The zipper is a little itchy if I don't have a shirt tucked in. There are several areas where the thread is tied off in a sloppy way, though it's not noticeable unless you are really up close to it, so no one is likely to notice but you. I wish the waistband were a little wider and stiffer, so that the weight was distributed over a wider area, since it can feel a little heavy. Overall, I love the skirt, and I'm happy I purchased it.

I have some festive tshirts, but have been looking for a sweater for the month, so when I found this, I completely fell in love! The design is so cute, and since it's a Modcloth Intarsia sweater, I knew it's be a decently thick, knitted fabric. The Intarsia Modcloth line is my favorite, and I've already purchased several from the collection, but to those who haven't: these sweaters run SMALL, I am normally a size M or even a size S for oversized sweaters, but these have a more flattering cut than a normal sweatshirt, so they do cling a bit. Also, the Intarsia sweater line is meant to have 3/4 sleeves that end above your wrist; I'm only five feet tall, so they are like normal sleeves for me, but if you are taller or have longer arms, they will be shorter, because they are meant to be. I see a lot of reviews complaining about this, when it is shown in the picture they are meant to be shorter, so be aware of that. Overall, this is probably my favorite sweater in my entire wardrobe, and as long as you are aware of how this sweater fits (smaller, shorter sleeves), then I HIGHLY recommend it!"

It is a good thing I got the small because the armholes are cut in a strange way that would not cover the chest well if I had gone down a size. It is like the front panel is slightly too narrow or the armholes are set slightly forward (it is certainly not due to a large chest). I don't know it is odd. The length is excellent at 5'9, I sometimes can't find tops that can be tucked into anything not highwaisted.  This is a bit sheer so a cami or immodesty will be needed. The stitching seems durable and the buttons don't feel like they will pop off.  The texture of the fabric is great my favorite part.  Overall, I like this blouse very much.

I have some festive tshirts, but have been looking for a sweater for the month, so when I found this, I completely fell in love! The design is so cute, and since it's a Modcloth Intarsia sweater, I knew it's be a decently thick, knitted fabric. The Intarsia Modcloth line is my favorite, and I've already purchased several from the collection, but to those who haven't: these sweaters run SMALL, I am normally a size M or even a size S for oversized sweaters, but these have a more flattering cut than a normal sweatshirt, so they do cling a bit. Also, the Intarsia sweater line is meant to have 3/4 sleeves that end above your wrist; I'm only five feet tall, so they are like normal sleeves for me, but if you are taller or have longer arms, they will be shorter, because they are meant to be. I see a lot of reviews complaining about this, when it is shown in the picture they are meant to be shorter, so be aware of that. Overall, this is probably my favorite sweater in my entire wardrobe, and as long as you are aware of how this sweater fits (smaller, shorter sleeves), then I HIGHLY recommend it!"

I'm still keeping it because it is cute, I just wish they'd post better pictures so I could see this because I would prefer the white version I thought it was. I also wish Modcloth would get their sizing consistent, because this one and the Retro Bloom Intarsia size L fit me, but the yellow one with white cat heads size M fits me better, even though they are the same brand and sweater, just with different designs.

It is a good thing I got the small because the armholes are cut in a strange way that would not cover the chest well if I had gone down a size.

The length is excellent at 5'9, I sometimes can't find tops that can be tucked into anything not highwaisted.  This is a bit sheer so a cami or immodesty will be needed. The stitching seems durable and the buttons don't feel like they will pop off.  The texture of the fabric is great my favorite part.  Overall, I like this blouse very much.

The piping is like a suede material?  Which feels and looks nice, but mine arrived kind of dirty.  Sure I'm going to wash it before I wear it anyway, but having something arrive looking a little dingy is never fun."

Anyway, I've recently graduated to a size US8 dress size, but sometimes find jeans a wee bit squeezy in size 8. The L in this model is near perfect for me  no muffin tops or tightness anywhere, just a nice formfitting feel. The only 'con' with the L for me is quite a bit of gaping at the back waist, which I'll fix with a bit of elastic inserted on the inside of the back waistband. For reference, I'm 29 (ish) waist, 39 hips, and 34 mid abdomen, which is where this waistband sits. The denim has a small amount of stretch and is quite soft.I had hoped these jeans would be high waisted, as they looked to be in the photos, but they are not, they are mid rise. I do think it would be useful if the front rise measurement were provided on all pants (front rise on these is 10, high waist would have to be 11.512). Another wee drawback is a too short zipper  4 zip on a 10 rise looks a bit odd, imo.NB Short girls  yes, these are long, but don't begrudge us tall girls much needed length!

But also like the others, it isn't as white as shown because these sweaters have a double layer on the front, a white outer layer with the design and a darker one that shows through underneath. You can't see it very well in the pictures, but the color isn't white, it's off white with darker peekaboo spots through the knit. I'm still keeping it because it is cute, I just wish they'd post better pictures so I could see this because I would prefer the white version I thought it was. I also wish Modcloth would get their sizing consistent, because this one and the Retro Bloom Intarsia size L fit me, but the yellow one with white cat heads size M fits me better, even though they are the same brand and sweater, just with different designs. Despite the small annoyances, I still really like it. It's a great fall top since it's sweaterthickness but short sleeved. I'd just try to get it on sale like I did."

This can also be casual or fancier, depending on the bottom you wear and if you wear a cardigan over it or something, which is great.

Also, the cut is loose (not baggy), so while it isn't bad looking, it doesn't flatter your figure much unless you tuck it into highwaisted bottoms, which I don't like. I got a size M, which is what I usually am in tops and dresses, so the largeness seemed strange.

It is a good thing I got the small because the armholes are cut in a strange way that would not cover the chest well if I had gone down a size.

The length is excellent at 5'9, I sometimes can't find tops that can be tucked into anything not highwaisted.  This is a bit sheer so a cami or immodesty will be needed. The stitching seems durable and the buttons don't feel like they will pop off.  The texture of the fabric is great my favorite part.  Overall, I like this blouse very much.

The large was perfect around my hips, but a bit loose through my waist. Once a couple darts were sewn into the waistband, these were a dream. The fabric is comfy and moves with me well when I'm out romping around. The pockets are perfect. The buttons are attached well. I imagine these may be a little long on someone shorter, but they were perfect for me. I often struggle to find shorts long enough. They look cute rolled up, so that would be an option for a shorter girl."

I have long arms and usually expect sleeves to be a little to short, but this was not even close, so if you are on the taller side, just be aware that you will be wearing this with the sleeves pushed up (which I don't  mind doing).  There also wasn't a lot of shape to the body of the sweater, but it looked nice on my frame so that's not a deal breaker for me.  It's comfy, the button detail is fun, and while short in length, it was long enough for my torso to wear with skirts.  I am returning it, though, because I didn't love the white/gray stripe, so will wait for it to come back in stock in the gold or blue/green stripe."

Learn how to check inseams or get your jeans hemmed. These jeans are great quality and a very nice fit for women who aren't too thick in the thighs. but if you have a  belly at all I wouldn't suggest them. I bought them in a size 14 because I read they ran small and narrow in the hips , but I probably could have used a size 12 and I am curvy so  they are very true to size. Anyone who says other wise is just used to buying their jeans too small."

The legs felt huuuuge but the waistband was almost uncomfortably tight."

I have bought probably over 25 cardigans over the past 5 years and I have to say that this cardigan is nice, but feels small.  I am 5'5, 130lbs and a size 36B bra and it feels more true to a medium than a large.  I usually buy my cardigans 1 size up so they are roomy and don't cling.  To play it safe, go up 1 size."

The zipper is in the back, and that is a little annoying.  The waist fit really well, and it makes my butt look great, but it pooches out a little in the front for me, rather than staying flat, especially when I'm walking.  The fabric is thinner than I expected. Also, the placement of the buttons are a little weird for me. They still look adorable when I am just standing, and they are pretty comfy, so I'll be keeping them, but I will make some alterations to them to suit my body a little better."

My problem is that from my waist up I'm XS and from my waist above I'm S. When I read the reviews I went for the Small, but it was like a size 6. I will return it. I really love the skirt so I think I will reorder a XS. You can take a look at my measurements. I'm really happy that Modcloth accept international returns."

I almost broke the zipper just trying to unzip it to try it on for the first time but I chalk that up to the zipper being really, really new?  I did get it on and I think I like it.  It's extremely wrinkley especially in the ruffle area but that's fine.  The main concern I wanted to share was that the fit in the butt is a little strange?  It seems to poof out right away from the waistband but it's tight around my actual backside which is p much completely flat.  I mean,  maybe it stretches there?  It's kind of hard for me to tell, honestly, but ladies with curvier bottoms might have some difficulty!"

It's amazingly soft, and slightly thicker than I expected (although yes it is a thin sweater). The softness of the fabric makes me feel like it will pill very quickly, but I'm hoping that will just add to the coziness. Or something, you know, lemons and lemonade. I ordered a M because I wasn't sure how stretchy it'd be and that's my failsafe size, and it fits great. Plenty of stretch but not too much. It's not quite leggingsappropriate length for me and I'm short, so that's a slight bummer but really no big deal. In all, great sweater, and can't wait for this freakishly hot Fall to end so I can wear it!"

I wanted it for Halloween but I feel like you can totally wear it casually all the time also. Lined, with pockets, side zip. Elastic in the back. I tend to fluctuate between small and medium but I feel like Modcloth's label runs small so I'm glad I got this in a medium, it's perfect with a tiny bit of wiggle room. Such a flattering skirt."

I am usually right between M and L, and I have a waist size of 29. The fit says that it Runs Large so I opted to try a medium. It was so tight I could barely get it on, and it was very uncomfortable. I didn't love it enough to go through the hassle of testing other sizes, so I don't know if an L would have fit, or if that would have also been too small. In conclusion, I have no idea whether to tell you to size up or down, but I can say that the one I received ran small, not large."

But...","This cardi had me as soon as I saw the beautiful rust color! But when I got my package and took it out of the wrapping, I was slightly bummed that the color didn't match the one shown on the website. I would say that the Rust cardi is actually more of a burnt orange (with brown undertones), and definitely not a true redorange color (see pics). Other than that, this is a really cute, crewneck style cardi, and the fit is slightly on the smaller side. I'm usually a small to medium, but I sized up and went with medium."

It does seem to run a bit large and as one reviewer mentioned it's boxy. I'm usually a size medium and I will be returning this for a small. This is a shirt that I think will look best tucked in because of the shape of it, but that may just be because it was a little big for me."

Sort of wish I would have gotten the XL instead of the 1X, but I can make these work with a belt and a longer shirt. The dark denim and higher waist are flattering for us fuller figure girls. Cons: I'm 5' 8 with a 33.5 inch inseam and these jeans are extremely long on me. I'm definitely going to have them altered if I can't make them work with platform boots or wedges. For now I'll roll them."
