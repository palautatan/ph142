Z-testing
=============

The general procedure for running a z-test (after identifying the parameter of interest and ensuring conditions are met) is:

1) State the null and alternative hypotheses
2) Calculate the z test statistic
3) Use the test statistic to find the p-value
4) Generate a conclusion about your hypotheses using your p-value (reject vs. fail to reject the null)

Remember that we run a z-test when we know the true population standard deviation, $\sigma$. You would be provided this value on the midterm.

Z-test conditions
============

The conditions to run a z-test include:

1) The sample is a SRS (simple random sample)
2) The data comes from a Normal distribution/population
3) The true, population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known


Step 1: Hypotheses
==========

Your hypotheses can be one-sided or two-sided.

- An example of a two-sided test is:

$$
H_0: \mu = 3, H_a: \mu \neq 3
$$

- Some examples of a one-sided test are:

$$
H_0: \mu = 3, H_a: \mu > 3
$$

or

$$
H_0: \mu = 3, H_a: \mu < 3
$$

Sometimes you are explicitly told what kind of a test to run. Other times, it is your responsibility to figure out which direction you test based on context from the word problem.


Step 2: Z-value calculation
=================

The formula for the z test statistic is:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

where:

- $\Bar{x}$ is the sample mean (aka the statistic)
- $\mu$ is the population mean that is part of the hypothesis (aka the parameter)
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation
- n is the sample size


Step 3: Finding the p-value
==========

Once we have our z-value, we can find the p-value. To help find the p-value, sketch the standard Normal curve and mark on it the observed value of z. Depending on whether you are performing a **one-sided test** or a **two-sided**, this will determine in which direction you calculate the p-value/probability:

Here is a visual to illustrate the differences

Use pnorm() functions to calculate your p-value. Remember we are working with a Standard normal.


Step 4: Interpreting p-values
============

Once we have our p-values, we can relate these back to our hypotheses and come to a conclusion. Be careful interpreting p-values! 

The p-value represents the probability, assuming that $H_0$ is true, that the test statistic would take a value at least as extreme (in the direction of $H_a$) as that actually observed. Note that the p-value is **NOT** the probability that the null hypothesis is true. 

The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$ provided by the data.

As a general rule of thumb, we:

- reject $H_0$ when p-value < $\alpha$
- fail to reject $H_0$ when p-value > $\alpha$

where $\alpha$ is *typically* set to 0.05 (**unless otherwise stated in the problem**).

Correct interpretations:

- If p < $\alpha$: We found a p-value of p = [p-value]. This is less than our cut-off value of $\alpha$ = [$\alpha$]. So we reject the null hypothesis that [null hypothesis] and have evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that [alternative hypothesis]

- If p > $\alpha$: We found a p-value of p = [p-value]. This is greater than our cut-off value of $\alpha$ = [$\alpha$]. so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that [null hypothesis] and do not have evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that [alternative hypothesis].

Example (try on your own)
============

An environmentalist group collects a liter of water from each of 45 random locations along a stream. The mean amount of dissolved oxygen per liter is 4.62 mg. Suppose
that we know that dissolved oxygen varies among locations according to a Normal
distribution with $\sigma$ = 0.92 mg. Is this strong evidence that the stream has a mean oxygen content of less than 5 mg per liter? Perform a hypothesis test by completing the following steps:

1) State your **null and alternate hypotheses** (hint: is it one-sided or two-sided?):

$$
H_0: 
$$

$$
H_a: 
$$

2) Calculate the **z-statistic**:

$$
z = 
$$

3) Find the **p-value**. Express this using probability notation, and write the proper pnorm() function to use.

**Probability notation**:

$$
p-value = 
$$

**Code**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pnorm(               )
```

4) Interpret your p-value.
